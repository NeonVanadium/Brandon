say Gwen The mask robs its wearer of free will, and whatever "gift" they have.
say Gwen In exchange. They become a slave of mine, and acquire instead the gift of self-duplication.
say Gwen The clones count as people on the island. If there were six clones of one person, no new parasites would arrive.
say Gwen A dissapearing clone does not count as a death. It should not cause new parasites to arrive.
move Gwen left 1
face Gwen Brandon
say Gwen As simply killing the parasites is futile, I've worked for years on perfecting this plan.
say Gwen Creating the mask. Using my powers to keep you parasites from understanding that my death is your way out.
say Gwen It would have worked, if the mask hadn't had the side-effect.
say Gwen It seems that when the mask is put on, the gift that is lost is reincarnated in an exact copy of the wearer's body.
say Gwen By coincidence, you happened to remove the seal I had placed on Julian.
say Gwen In so doing, you allowed him to communicate his visions to others. In this way, you have unraveled me.
